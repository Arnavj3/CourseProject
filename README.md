Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview/Week 9 Activities.

To run the code follow the following steps:
- Unzip the provided CSV file and upload it to your google drive
- open the notebook in google drive and run the cell which reads the CSV (This will require you to mount your drive and should not take more than a few seconds)
- run the cell that reads the unnormalized dataset and run all the cells that follow
- the last cell will have the following search fields:
    artist, album, year, sentiment, profanity and lyric. You can use these search fields to find a song you're looking for.
